The code uses Misskey's APIs, which you must change to your own:

MISSKEY_API_BASE_URL = ''

ACCESS_TOKEN = ''

The code uses Flickr's APIs, which you have to insert as well:

FLICKR_PUBLIC = ''

FLICKR_SECRET = ''

The code uses OpenCage Geocoder APIs to translate numeric coordinates into human-readable coordinates. Also insert your own:

OPENCAGE_API_KEY = ''
